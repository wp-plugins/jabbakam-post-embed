Converts any Jabbakam shared video URLs into embedded Videoclips

== Description ==

This plugin, when installed and activated, will automatically convert any Jabbakam shared video URLs found in the 
post content into embeded videoclips.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jabbakam` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Now, any valid Jabbakam shared video urls you place in blog posts will be replaced automatically by an embedded

Just copy and paste your Jabbakam shared video url straight into the body of your blog post.

== About Jabbakam ==

Jabbakam is a unique system for the remote management and networking of IP cameras. A Jabbakam network can be two 
or more users monitoring a single camera, or an international community sharing footage across the globe. Jabbakam 
networks enable groups of people with a shared interest to view video footage recorded on their cameras online as 
and when they want.
